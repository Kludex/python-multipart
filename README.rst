python-multipart is an Apache2 licensed streaming multipart parser for Python.  It's still under some development, but test coverage is currently 100%.

Why?
----

Because streaming uploads are awesome for large files.  Examples will be coming soon :)

How to Test
-----------

If you want to test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ py.test
